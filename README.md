# Properties of Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes for Multidimensional Input
 Project for module R250 at the University of Cambridge: 
 > Properties of Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes for Multidimensional Input

The experiment can be run using the modules with the prefix `experiment_` and the specific experiment should be clear
from the suffix and docstrings.

Heatplots can be created with `evaluate_experiment_increase_dimension.py` and `compare_results.py` creates plots to
compare two experiments at a certain number of inducing points.
